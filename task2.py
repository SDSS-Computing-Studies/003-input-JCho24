# Find the volume of a sphere.
# You will ask the user to enter the radius of the sphere.
# Calculate the Volume and then display the result to the user.
# You will need to import the math module in order to use math.pi

# Inputs:
# radius
#
# Outputs
# volume
#
# test output radius of 3 should give volume of 84.8230016469

import math

print("The formula for the volume of a sphere is " + Fsphere)
print("Type in a radius and it will determine the volume of the sphere")
radius = input()
radius = float(radius)
VSphere = 4/3 * math.pi * radius**3
print("The volume of the Sphere = " ,end="")
